# CryptPy
CryptPy is a simple program written in python that generates a key, encrypts and decrypts files with that key.

CryptPy is available in two versions CLI and GUI.

## ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️
The encryption of the file is associated with the key created, do not lose the `key.key` file otherwise it will be impossible to decrypt the file.

## CLI
### Usage
```python
python cryptpy.py
```

#### Follow the step
- Generate a key with `option 1`, this will create a key.key file
- Encrypt a file with `option 2`
- Decrypt the file previously encrypted with `option 3`
